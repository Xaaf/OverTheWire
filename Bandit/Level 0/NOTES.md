# Level 0
This level should be easy. All we need to do is SSH into the server.

## Solution
All we gotta do is execute a simple SSH command: `ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220`, and we're in! Well, almost. We still need to enter the password, but that's simple. Just type `bandit0` and you're *actually* in.
