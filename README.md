# OverTheWire - Notes and solutions
*The solutions in this repository are not perfect. Most likely they're far from perfect. I made this repository to track my progress through the challenges, and to have a place to keep my notes!*

## How is the repository structured, and what will I find?
The structure of the repository is fairly straight-forward. Each Wargames game has its own folder in the root. Then there's a folder for each level. Those folders contain a `NOTES.md` file, and possibly other files, depending on what I used to solve the level. The `NOTES.md` file will also contain the solution and the sources I used. Both of these have their own headers, so everything should be neatly organised!

## Who am I, and why is this repository a thing?
Well, I'm just another 17 year-old with an interest in this sector. I'm basically doing this just for fun. Why did I make this repository a thing then? Well, I wanted a way to track my progress, since I started these Wargames for a school-thing. Besides that I also wanted to have my progress publicly available so potential fellow players could maybe learn something!

## Can I give tips/feedback?
**Yes!** I'll gladly take any tips or feedback you have! Just make a new [Issue](https://github.com/Xaaf/OverTheWire/issues/new) with the related level and your feedback! I'd love to take the feedback so that I can get better at these Wargames and learn some tricks!
